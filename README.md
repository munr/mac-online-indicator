## Why Online Indicator?

The macOS WiFi icon only shows that you are connected to a router, not whether your internet is actually working or being blocked. Online Indicator replaces it with a live status icon that verifies real internet connectivity at the network level, so you can instantly see if you are online, offline, or blocked without opening any apps, giving you a smarter and slightly geekier way to understand your connection at a glance.

<br>

## Features

🛜 **Ditch the boring Wi-Fi icon** <br>
Your menu bar deserves better than a grey Wi-Fi symbol that tells you nothing. Online Indicator replaces it with a live status icon that actually means something: <br>
- Green when you're online <br>
- Yellow when something's off <br>
- Red when there's no network

🎨 **Make it yours** <br>
Choose from 17 ready made Icon Sets or use any SF Symbol, set custom colours and labels for each state, and save your setup as your own Icon Set to switch anytime with a single tap.

📡 **Flexible monitoring** <br>
Choose any URL to ping and set how often the check runs, from every 30 seconds to once an hour.

👀 **Quick IP peek** <br>
Your IPv4 and IPv6 are always one click away in the menu, tap to copy instantly.

## Download & Install

### 1 · Download
Head to the [**Latest Release**](../../releases/latest) page and grab the latest `.dmg` file.

### 2 · Install
Open the `.dmg` and drag **Online Indicator** into your **Applications** folder. Done.

### 3 · First Launch

#### Option A — System Settings

1. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security**
2. Scroll down until you see Online Indicator listed as blocked
3. Click **Open Anyway** and enter your password

#### Option B — Terminal

Paste this into Terminal and press Enter:
```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Online\ Indicator.app
```
Then open the app normally.

> 💡 **Why does this happen?**
> Apple requires a $99/year developer certificate to "notarise" apps. Online Indicator is free and independent, so it skips that. The warning is Apple's way of flagging uncertified apps, not a sign that anything is wrong.

<br>

## Privacy Policy

Online Indicator collects no data. Period.

- No analytics, crash reporting or usage tracking
- No personal information collected or transmitted
- All preferences are stored locally on your Mac

The only outbound network request the app makes is the connectivity probe, a simple HTTP request to `captive.apple.com` (or your custom URL) to check if the internet is reachable. This is identical to what macOS itself does internally.
