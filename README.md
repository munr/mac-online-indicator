## Why Online Indicator?

The macOS WiFi icon only shows that you are connected to a router, not whether your internet is actually working or being blocked. Online Indicator replaces it with a live status icon that verifies real internet connectivity at the network level, so you can instantly see if you are online, offline, or blocked without opening any apps, giving you a smarter and slightly geekier way to understand your connection at a glance.

## Features

🛜 **Ditch the boring Wi-Fi icon** <br>
Your menu bar deserves better than a grey Wi-Fi symbol that tells you nothing. Online Indicator replaces it with a live status icon that actually means something: <br>
🟢 Green when you're online <br>
🟡 Yellow when something's off <br>
🔴 Red when you're out <br>
Three states, always in sight, no guessing.

🎨 **Make it yours** <br>
Choose any SF Symbol as your icon, pick any colour for each state, add a custom text label that shows right in the menu bar, or apply one of 15 ready-made Icon Sets to change the whole look in a single tap.

📡 **Flexible monitoring** <br>
Choose any URL to ping and set how often the check runs, from every 30 seconds to once an hour.

🔍 **Quick IP peek** <br>
Your IPv4 and IPv6 are always one click away in the menu, tap to copy instantly.

## Download & Install

### 1 · Download
Head to the [**Latest Release**](../../releases/latest) page and grab the latest `.dmg` file.

### 2 · Install
Open the `.dmg` and drag **Online Indicator** into your **Applications** folder. Done.

### 3 · First Launch

#### Option A — System Settings

1. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security**
2. Scroll down until you see Online Indicator listed as blocked
3. Click **Open Anyway** and enter your password

#### Option B — Terminal

Paste this into Terminal and press Enter:
```bash

```
Then open the app normally.

> 💡 **Why does this happen?**
> Apple requires a $99/year developer certificate to "notarise" apps. Online Indicator is free and independent, so it skips that. The warning is Apple's way of flagging uncertified apps, not a sign that anything is wrong.

## Privacy Policy

Online Indicator collects no data. Period.

- No analytics, crash reporting or usage tracking
- No personal information collected or transmitted
- All preferences are stored locally on your Mac

The only outbound network request the app makes is the connectivity probe, a simple HTTP request to `captive.apple.com` (or your custom URL) to check if the internet is reachable. This is identical to what macOS itself does internally.
